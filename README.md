# Neural Network for Moon Dataset Classification

This project implements a two-layer neural network from scratch to solve a binary classification problem on the **non-linearly separable** moon dataset. The neural network achieves approximately **96% accuracy**, outperforming traditional logistic regression which achieves around 87% on the same dataset.
